            <dt>DOCTYPE Statement</dt>
            <dd>- This instructs the web browser about the information on the HTML document when rendering.</dd>
            <dt>ol</dt>
            <dd>- The tags, ol and /ol, signify an ordered list, which means that the list will show up numbered on the webpage. The tags in between need to be li and /li to list whatever items you want to list. </dd>
            <dt>ul</dt>
            <dd>- The tags, ul and /ul, signify an unordered list, which means that the list will be bulleted and unnumbered. The tags in between need to be li and /li to list whatever items you want to list.</dd>
            <dt>dl</dt>
            <dd>- The tags, dl an /dl, signify a description list, which means that the list items will have descriptions. In between these tags, you will need to put the tags, dt and /dt to add the term you'd like to describe, and then underneath, you can put dd and /dd for the actual description of said term.</dd>

            <dt>Difference between text editor and word processor?</dt>
            <dd> -Text editor: A text editor allows someone to edit and make text files and are usually used for coding and programming. A "smart" text editor (like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++) knows what syntax you are working with.</dd>
            <dd> -Word processor: Contrary to a text editor, a word processor is generally more complex and allows the user to create and change the formatting of documents, these documents generally used on just one platform. </dd>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <dt>Client-Server Model</dt>
            <dd>- The client-server model, also known as the client-server architecture, is a framework where tasks are partitioned between servers (those who provide a service) and service requesters, who are the clients. An example of this model in applications would be Email, or the World Wide Web.</dd>
            <dt>FTP</dt>
            <dd>- FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a method to move and transfer files from between locations and computer systems. This requires internet connection.
            <dt>HTTP</dt>
            <dd>- HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. This is a foundational aspect of the World Wide Web (or WWW). It is used to load data and webpages, where URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) can be linked through hypertext.</dd>
            <dt>TCP/IP</dt>
            <dd>- TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. This makes it so that computers on the same network can communicate with each other. This is a two-layer process and protocol, the TCP layer being the transport layer. This allows for the communication, whereas the IP layer (Internet layer), keeps track of routing information between computers. </dd>
